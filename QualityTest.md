# getDocById - Performance Test

**Redis Cache Missed**  
- Average response time (1K requests): **388 ms**

**Redis Cache Hit**  
- Average response time (1K requests): **146 ms**

**Performance Improvement**  
- With caching enabled, we observed a **165%** increase in speed.

## Future Testing

1. **Cache Hit Rate**  
   - Measure the proportion of cache hits versus total requests to quantify overall caching effectiveness.
